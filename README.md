We have had a sensational local elections on the 30th of March in Turkey. A lot of fraud, vote thefts and cheating not imagined even in a dream has happened.

There were mainly three parties running for the elections: AKP which is the current ruler party, CHP and MHP which are opposition parties.

After this introduction about the situation in Turkey, this project is aimed to provide visual data to people who wanted to see the vote distribution in their ballot boxes. Moreover you can publish the stinking ballot boxes in Facebook so that you can make eyes of more people opened. 

There is also an open end of making statistical analysis of this data to produce more meaningful results.

You can access the system from <a href="http://www.ogzd.me">my personal website</a> currently, but it is open to change.
